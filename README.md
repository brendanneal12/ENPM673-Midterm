Midterm Details: Theory (not in code), Hough Lines, Image Transformation, Object Detection and Labeling, K-Means (not in code)

Recommended Workspace: Visual Studio Code

Libraries Used: numpy, opencv, math, from matplotlib: pyplot, random

Note: random was used to help me generate random, different colors for labeling balloons.

Before you run code: make sure to have ball.mov, hotairbaloon.jpg, train_track.jpg, and Neal_Midterm_Script.py in your workspace folder.

# HOW TO RUN CODE:

1. Open Neal_Midterm_Script.py in VSCode.
2. Hit "Run"

PROBLEM 2
3. The ball detection output video will be displayed to screen.
4. Observe the outputted ball detection video, then close the video.

PROBLEM 3
5. The original train track image will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
6. The train track image with 4 points of interest (plotted in red) will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
7. The outputted top-down image will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
8. The grayscale top-down image will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
9. The blurred grayscale top-down image will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
10. The edge-detected top-down image will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
11. The Hough lines for the top-down image will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
12. The average distance between the train tracks in pixels will be printed to your terminal. Please Note.

PROBLEM 4
13. The grayscale image of the balloons will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
14. The blurred grayscale image of the balloons will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
15. The original thresholded image of the balloons will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
16. The thresholded image after morphology will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close to move on.
17. The identified balloons (by method of bounding boxes) will be displayed to your screen. Observe the image, then close.
